- 👋 Hi, I’m Colton
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming and game development, reading, movies, animation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, otherwise another thing I'm interested in is learning game development and aspects of it such as asset designsuch as voice acting, storyboarding, setting and level design, I've had a passion for it for some time but have rarely hasd time to sit down and actually learn about it from more than just the odd youtube video that might pop in my feed from time to time.
- 💞️ I’m eventually hoping to collaborate with others in game development, once I have the know how to carry myself through these projects I'd like to be of assistance to others
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm active on a few platforms such as discord and bluesky, my discord is @gumball6232 and my Bluesky is @thehairygumball.bsky.social
- 😄 Pronouns: My pronouns are He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm also an aspiring voice actor, I've been told for years that I have a voice that stands out and I love talking, so on top of software development that's also something I've been lightly pursuing off to the side
